# IdentitySwitcher
The IdentitySwitcher is a simple and useful tool to allow you to switch between users, without knowing their passwords.

This is an excellent tool to use during **development** and **testing**. Place the module in the toppane of every page and login in as a different users is just one click away. Test functionality of your site for the various users. 

It is even possible to switch to a host user, when allowed by the host account in the settings of the module.

Remove the module before going live?
